# Multi-Agent System with NVIDIA NeMo and Firecrawl

A multi-agent system capable of developing functional applications using NVIDIA NeMo and Firecrawl. The system employs multiple specialized agents to handle different aspects of application development, from requirement gathering to code generation and testing.

## Key Features

- 🤖 Multiple specialized agents working in coordination
- 🕷️ **Advanced Web Scraping with Firecrawl**
  - Intelligent code example collection
  - Documentation aggregation
  - Library compatibility analysis
  - Pattern recognition across multiple sources
- 🧠 NVIDIA NeMo integration for advanced language processing
- 🔒 Secure code execution in isolated Docker environments
- 📊 AstraDB integration for data persistence and RAG capabilities
- 🔍 Vector-based search for similar code patterns
- 🔄 Automated error recovery and code regeneration

## Architecture

The system uses a multi-agent architecture where each agent has a specific role:

1. **Requirement Collector**: Processes and structures user requirements
2. **Code Generator**: Creates code based on requirements and examples
3. **Validator**: Tests and validates generated code
4. **Coordinator**: Manages workflow and agent communication

## Firecrawl Integration

Firecrawl is used to:
- Gather relevant code examples from multiple sources
- Analyze common patterns in similar applications
- Collect best practices and documentation
- Identify potential security issues
- Find compatible libraries and dependencies

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- NVIDIA GPU (optional, for enhanced performance)
- AstraDB account and API credentials
- Firecrawl API key
- NVIDIA API key
